   	 <p>My name is Nomadtrader the Coder. It is a strange name isn't it? What makes it even more starnge is that I don't know how to code...yet. I have recently started a coding bootcamp. It is an intensive experience, but I am loving every minute of it and learning so much that my brain is having trouble digesting it. But that is exactly how I want this bootcamp to be. I want to learn as much as possible in as little time as possible so I can around to working on my own project.</p> 
     <p>The thought of one day learning how to code has always been on my mind, but I never felt a sense of urgency to do so. It was more like a "Bucket List" item. But a couple of months ago all that changed as I started working on a personal project that I wanted to do. This project requires the ceation of a large web application and in my case the the option of hiring a third party to do what I had in mind was not an option. And that is how I ended up my coding journey.</p>
